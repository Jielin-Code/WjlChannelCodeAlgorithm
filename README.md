# WjlChannelCodeAlgorithm
The following is a summary of my paper, which is based on the test program given in the paper.
Let the binary Bernoulli source sequence input into the symmetric discrete memoryless channel (DMC) be X, and linearly substitute the “1” in X with “10” to obtain the sequence Q, then the sequence Q satisfies the condition that each “1” is separate by one or multiple “0”. There are lots of ways to convert sequence X into sequence Q, which are collectively referred to as source processing. The transmitting end uses a weighted probability model to linearly encode the sequence Q. The receiving end performs weighted probability model decoding. If more than one “1” is continuously decoded, the data transmission has errors. Then the forward error correction decoding method is constructed based on the characteristics of BSC (ξ) and BEC (ε) channel model. It has been proved that when the code length approaches infinity, the coding method in this paper enables the transmission rate to approximate the channel capacity, and the average decoding error probability approaches 0. Simulated with 1/2 code rate in the Binary Input Additive White Gaussian Noise (BIAWGN) channel, the block error rate (BLER) of this method is lower than that of Polar codes and Low-Density Parity-Check Codes (LDPC).
